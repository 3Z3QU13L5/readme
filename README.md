# readme

This repository has a few templates for README files and some notes about which type of information you could write on them.


## Prepare the content

Readme files are made for developers (including you), but also could be used for the final users. 
So while you are writing your readme files please consider a few things:

1. What is about?
    - Describe the content of your project or repository
    - Explain things the users would have a hard time understanding right away 
2. What steps need to be taken?
    - Do they need to install any software?
    - Is there any hardware requirements or dependencies?
    - After the installation, how they compile or run the code?
3. Execution examples
    - You could provide examples of execution with code and screenshots

other things you could add:

- Table of content
- Test cases
- Know bugs
- Version
- Contributors
- License
- References
